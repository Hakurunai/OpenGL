Using GLFW 3.4 for WIN64, lib-vc2022
Using Glad (already included in the repo)
Using OpenGL 4.6 (LibPreparator will only check if your current version is under this one or not)
using .NET 8.0 -> sdk here : https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0 (not included via LibPreparator)


To get the necessary libraries, please launch the LibPreparator application at this path :


LibPreparator -> Application.zip (need extraction) -> target -> LibPreparator application

PS : for the macos, use this cli command inside the 
directory (need dotnet to be functionnal) : dotnet LibPreparator.dll

PPS : i worked on Win 11 and i've currently not tried myself the linux and macos version.I tried to learn as if
it is a cross platform project, but all this part is self-taught and i need to advance elsewhere.
